# Movie Recommendations Engine

This is what I created for the final project in Juno College's JavaScript course.

A basic movie recommendation engine that makes 2 API calls to search TMDB for a movie you like and then generate a list of recommendations based on that movie. 

Built using JavaScript, jQuery, and the TMDB API.
